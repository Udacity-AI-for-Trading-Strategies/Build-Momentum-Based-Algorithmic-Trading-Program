# Build Momentum-Based Algorithmic Trading Program

## Project Introduction

The S&P 500 (Standard & Poor's 500) is a stock market index that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. It is widely regarded as one of the best representations of the U.S. stock market and economy. Over the long term, the S&P 500 has shown consistent growth, making it a key focus for long-term investors. However, it can also experience significant volatility in the short term.

In this project, we will make our first attempt to build a momentum-based strategy to trade the S&P 500 index.
